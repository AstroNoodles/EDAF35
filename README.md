# EDAF35
This is a repository for the EDAF35 "Operating Systems" course in Lund University
for the fall 2023 semester. I struggled a lot with this course since there is a big gap between introductory C and the start of the first lab, building a shell, so I thought I would document my code here so that people could use my code to understand how best to do the labs.

Check out each of the labs by their folder structure
* **Lab 0**: [Introduction to Git](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab0)
* **Lab 1**: [Creating A Shell](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab1_shell)
* **Lab 2**: [UNIX Signals](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab2_sig)
* **Lab 3**: [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab3_vm)
* **Lab 4**: [Custom File System](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab4_fs)
* **Lab 5**: [Make Your Own 'malloc' and 'free'](https://github.com/AstroNoodles/EDAF35/tree/main/lab5_mm)

You have to **pass all the labs** in order to pass the course.
However, you don't need to memorize lab code in order to pass the exam.
Look at the lectures for that!
